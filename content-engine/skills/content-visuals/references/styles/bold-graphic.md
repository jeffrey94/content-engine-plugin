# Bold Graphic

## Brief
High-contrast illustration with large geometric shapes, dramatic composition, and strong visual impact designed to grab attention instantly.

## When to Use
- **Content Pillars:** Policy & Compliance (urgent announcements), Industry Opportunities (big news)
- **Topic Signals:** urgent, deadline, breaking, new, must, critical, mandatory, important, warning, announcement, launches, mega project, billion, major
- **Audience Context:** When the article communicates urgency, importance, or excitement. Designed to stop the scroll on social media and demand attention. Best for content that needs to be seen NOW.

## Core Characteristics
Bold graphic is the loudest style in the system. It uses oversized shapes, high contrast, and dramatic negative space to create images that command attention even at thumbnail size. Think poster design, protest art, or bold magazine covers. The compositions are asymmetric and dynamic. This style sacrifices nuance for impact -- it is not subtle, and that is the point.

## Lines
- **Stroke Weight:** Heavy, 3-5px. Bold and confident.
- **Endpoints:** Sharp, squared-off ends for aggressive feel. Rounded only for softer elements.
- **Shape Vocabulary:** Large geometric blocks, sharp angles, oversized arrows, bold dividing lines. Shapes fill most of the frame.
- **Borders:** Strong border frames allowed. Thick dividing lines between sections.
- **Impact Lines:** Radiating lines, burst patterns, or converging angles to create energy.

## Texture
- **Fill:** Solid flat fills with maximum contrast. Adjacent colors should be dramatically different.
- **Background:** Bold solid color, high-contrast split, or dramatic diagonal divide.
- **Patterns:** Halftone dots, bold stripes, or geometric patterns at high visibility. Patterns are a feature, not subtle.
- **Contrast:** Push contrast to maximum. Light elements against dark backgrounds. Bright accents against muted fields.

## Depth
- **Dimensionality:** Flat 2D. Depth created through scale contrast (large foreground vs small background), not spatial depth.
- **Shadows:** None or hard-edge dramatic shadows (not soft/diffused). Block shadows only.
- **Layering:** Aggressive overlapping. Large foreground elements partially cover background elements to create visual hierarchy.
- **Scale:** Exaggerated scale differences. Key element fills 50-60% of frame while supporting elements are significantly smaller.

## Color Application
- **Primary Color:** Dominant. Fills 50%+ of the colored area. Used for the largest shape or background.
- **Secondary Color:** Counter-balance. Creates the primary contrast (30%).
- **Accent Color:** Used for the single most important element -- a number, a word, an arrow (10%).
- **High Contrast:** Adjacent colors must have strong value contrast. Light vs dark, warm vs cool.
- **Background:** Either very dark (near black) or very bright (primary color at full saturation).
- **Rule:** Fewer colors, higher contrast. Three colors maximum including background.

## Element Vocabulary
- **Approved:** Oversized text as graphic element (a big "RM50K" or "DEADLINE"), bold arrows and pointers, exclamation/warning symbols, large simple icons (shield, clock, alert triangle), geometric shapes used as frames or dividers, bold numbers and statistics
- **Forbidden:** Detailed illustrations, subtle icons, complex scenes, gentle curves, delicate elements, soft washes, small text-heavy layouts
- **Malaysian Context:** Bold RM figures as graphic elements, oversized deadline dates, simplified government logos at large scale, impactful Malaysian data points as visual centerpieces

## Typography Approach
- **Font Category:** Heavy display sans-serif (Impact, Bebas Neue, or brand display font at max weight)
- **Weight:** Extra bold / black weight. Type itself is a graphic element.
- **Sizing:** Oversized. Headlines can fill 30-40% of the image area. Small text avoided entirely.
- **Text-on-Image:** Text IS the image in many cases. Large typographic treatments as the primary visual element.
- **Case:** ALL CAPS for headlines to maximize impact.
- **Special:** Highlighted text (background color behind key words), outlined text, or split-color text treatments.

## Prompt Fragments

**style_descriptor:**
"Bold graphic poster style with high-contrast colors, oversized geometric shapes, and dramatic asymmetric composition. Large shapes fill most of the frame. Typography is used as a graphic element -- oversized, bold, and commanding. The overall effect is immediate visual impact, designed to stop the scroll and demand attention. Think bold magazine cover or impactful infographic poster."

**visual_constraints:**
"High contrast between all adjacent elements, maximum 3 colors including background, heavy 3-5px line weight, oversized shapes filling 50%+ of frame, bold display typography as graphic element, flat 2D with no depth effects, dramatic scale contrast between elements, squared-off endpoints, aggressive asymmetric composition"

**negative_prompt:**
"No subtle elements, no soft gradients, no delicate lines, no detailed illustrations, no gentle curves, no pastel colors, no complex multi-element scenes, no small text, no realistic rendering, no photographic elements, no 3D effects, no decorative flourishes"

## Compatibility Notes
- **Moods:** Energetic (recommended -- the natural pairing for maximum impact), Professional (good -- restrained version with darker palette). **Avoid Warm** -- bold's aggressive energy directly contradicts warm's gentle approachability.
- **Image Types:** All three (recommended). This style's large simple forms scale perfectly from cover-hero to tiny facebook-card thumbnail. Especially effective for social media where attention is the scarcest resource.
- **Brand Palette:** Works best with strong, saturated brand colors. May need adjustment if brand palette is very muted or pastel.
- **Use Sparingly:** This style is powerful but can fatigue readers if used on every article. Reserve for genuinely important or urgent content.
