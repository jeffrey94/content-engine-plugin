# Minimal Line

## Brief
Single-weight line art with maximum whitespace, very few elements, and elegant restraint -- the sophisticated, premium choice.

## When to Use
- **Content Pillars:** All pillars (as a premium alternative). Primary fit: Policy & Compliance (executive communications), Funding & Financing (high-level strategy)
- **Topic Signals:** premium, executive, leadership, strategy, board, sophisticated, elegant, overview, summary, annual, report
- **Audience Context:** When the audience includes senior decision-makers or when the content is high-level strategic thinking. Also works when you want a distinctive, non-generic visual identity. The emptiness itself communicates confidence.

## Core Characteristics
Minimal line art is defined by what it leaves out. A single consistent line weight draws a few essential shapes on a vast white canvas. The restraint is intentional -- every line earns its place. The result is elegant, distinctive, and quietly confident. Like a luxury brand's packaging, the whitespace is the main design element. This style stands out precisely because it does so little.

## Lines
- **Stroke Weight:** Single consistent weight throughout, 1.5-2px. Never varies. This consistency is the defining feature.
- **Endpoints:** Clean, rounded caps. Precise but not aggressive.
- **Shape Vocabulary:** Simple outlines only. No filled shapes. Objects reduced to their minimal recognizable form.
- **Borders:** None. The image bleeds into whitespace naturally.
- **Continuity:** Lines can be continuous (one unbroken stroke) or broken into minimal segments. Prefer fewer strokes.

## Texture
- **Fill:** None. Lines only -- no filled areas. The single exception: one small element can be filled with brand accent color for emphasis.
- **Background:** Pure white or very light neutral. No texture, no patterns, nothing.
- **Patterns:** None. Any pattern would contradict the minimal philosophy.
- **Emptiness:** 60-70% of the image should be empty/white space. This is not wasted space -- it IS the design.

## Depth
- **Dimensionality:** Flat 2D line drawings. No attempt at depth.
- **Shadows:** None.
- **Layering:** Minimal overlapping. Elements are spaced with generous distance between them.

## Color Application
- **Primary Color (Line Color):** All lines drawn in one color -- either brand primary or a dark neutral (charcoal, near-black).
- **Accent Color:** ONE small element filled or highlighted with brand accent color. This single pop of color is the visual anchor.
- **Background:** White or off-white only.
- **Rule:** Maximum 2 colors total: line color + one accent fill. The restraint is non-negotiable.

## Element Vocabulary
- **Approved:** Simple outline icons (single-stroke where possible), continuous line drawings, minimal abstract shapes, single-line portraits (faceless), simple outline charts/graphs, essential object outlines reduced to fewest possible lines
- **Forbidden:** Filled shapes (except one accent), complex illustrations, multiple colors, busy compositions, decorative elements, patterns, textures, realistic rendering
- **Malaysian Context:** Single-line outline of Petronas Towers, minimal RM symbol, simple outline of Malaysian map, one-stroke shophouse silhouette

## Typography Approach
- **Font Category:** Light or thin-weight sans-serif (Helvetica Light, Inter Thin, or brand font at lightest weight)
- **Weight:** Light or thin. Matches the single-weight line art.
- **Sizing:** Can be large (the whitespace accommodates big type) but in light weight.
- **Text-on-Image:** Text floats in whitespace. Perfect readability guaranteed by the empty background.
- **Alignment:** Centered or asymmetrically placed with intentional balance against the illustration.

## Prompt Fragments

**style_descriptor:**
"Minimal single-weight line art illustration on a white background. Very few elements drawn with consistent 1.5-2px lines. 60-70% of the image is empty white space. One small element filled with a single accent color. The aesthetic is elegant, sophisticated, and quietly confident -- maximum restraint, maximum impact through simplicity."

**visual_constraints:**
"Single consistent line weight (1.5-2px) throughout, no filled shapes except one accent element, maximum 2 colors (line color + one accent), 60-70% white space, no textures, no patterns, no shadows, no depth effects, minimal elements (3-5 line drawings maximum), pure white or off-white background, light/thin-weight typography"

**negative_prompt:**
"No filled areas except one accent, no gradients, no shadows, no textures, no patterns, no busy compositions, no multiple colors, no heavy line weights, no 3D effects, no photographic elements, no complex illustrations, no decorative elements, no dark backgrounds"

## Compatibility Notes
- **Moods:** Professional (recommended -- elegant authority), Warm (good -- the single accent color adds warmth). **Avoid Energetic** -- minimal's restraint directly contradicts energetic's vibrancy and dynamism.
- **Image Types:** Recommended for ALL types. The simplicity scales perfectly. Minimal line art looks equally elegant at cover-hero size and facebook-card thumbnail.
- **Brand Palette:** Works with any palette. Only needs a line color and one accent color. Very flexible.
- **Distinctiveness:** This style is highly distinctive in social media feeds where most content is visually busy. Standing out by doing less.
