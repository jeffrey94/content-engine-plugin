# Flat Vector

## Brief
Clean geometric illustration with uniform line weight, solid color fills, and no gradients or shadows.

## When to Use
- **Content Pillars:** Policy & Compliance (primary), Practical Guides (secondary)
- **Topic Signals:** e-invoicing, tax, regulation, compliance, licensing, SSM, LHDN, filing, checklist
- **Audience Context:** When content needs to feel modern, trustworthy, and easy to parse. Good for compliance-heavy topics where visual clarity reduces intimidation.

## Core Characteristics
Flat vector reduces complex business concepts to their simplest visual forms using geometric shapes and solid color blocks. The style feels modern and digital -- like a polished infographic or app icon. There is no visual noise: no textures, no depth cues, no photographic elements. Every shape serves a purpose.

## Lines
- **Stroke Weight:** Uniform 2-3px throughout. No variation in line thickness.
- **Endpoints:** Rounded caps and joins for a friendly feel.
- **Shape Vocabulary:** Circles, rounded rectangles, simple polygons. Prefer geometric over organic shapes.
- **Borders:** Optional thin border around the full image (1px, muted color). No decorative borders.
- **Corners:** Consistently rounded (4-8px radius) on all rectangular elements.

## Texture
- **Fill:** Solid color blocks only. No gradients, no noise, no grain.
- **Background:** Single solid color or simple two-tone split (60/40).
- **Patterns:** Minimal. Occasional simple dot grid or thin line pattern for subtle visual interest, never dominant.
- **Overlaps:** When shapes overlap, use opacity reduction (70-80%) on the overlapping shape to create layering without shadows.

## Depth
- **Dimensionality:** Strictly 2D. No perspective, no vanishing points.
- **Shadows:** None. Depth conveyed only through layering order and subtle size differences.
- **Layering:** 2-3 layers maximum. Background layer, mid-ground element layer, foreground accent layer.

## Color Application
- **Primary Color:** Used for the main subject/focal element (40-50% of colored area).
- **Secondary Color:** Used for supporting elements and large background shapes (30%).
- **Accent Color:** Used sparingly for small highlights, checkmarks, arrows, emphasis elements (10%).
- **Background:** Brand background color (light or dark depending on mood).
- **Neutrals:** Use brand text colors for any gray/muted elements.
- **Rule:** Maximum 4-5 distinct colors per image. Flat vector thrives on restraint.

## Element Vocabulary
- **Approved:** Simplified icons (calculator, document, shield, checkmark, calendar, clock, coins, building silhouettes), geometric infographic elements (pie segments, bar shapes, arrow flows), abstract business symbols
- **Forbidden:** Realistic objects, photographic elements, complex illustrations, detailed faces, hand-drawn elements, 3D objects
- **Malaysian Context:** Simplified LHDN/SSM building silhouettes, stylized Malaysian flag elements (crescent, star as geometric shapes), RM currency symbol as design element

## Typography Approach
- **Font Category:** Clean sans-serif (Helvetica Neue, Inter, or brand heading font)
- **Weight:** Bold for headlines, regular for body text
- **Sizing:** Large and confident. Headlines should be prominent.
- **Text-on-Image:** Text sits on solid color blocks or clear whitespace. Never overlay text on complex visual elements.
- **Alignment:** Left-aligned or centered. No justified text.

## Prompt Fragments

**style_descriptor:**
"Clean flat vector illustration style with uniform line weight, solid color fills, and no gradients or shadows. Geometric shapes, rounded corners, modern infographic aesthetic. Strictly 2D with no perspective or depth effects."

**visual_constraints:**
"Uniform 2-3px line weight throughout, solid color fills only, no gradients, no textures, no shadows, no 3D effects, maximum 4-5 distinct colors, rounded corners on all rectangular elements, geometric shapes only, clean sans-serif typography"

**negative_prompt:**
"No gradients, no shadows, no textures, no grain, no 3D effects, no perspective, no photographic elements, no realistic rendering, no hand-drawn elements, no watercolor effects, no complex detailed illustrations"

## Compatibility Notes
- **Moods:** Professional (recommended), Warm (good), Energetic (good). Works with all moods.
- **Image Types:** Excellent for all three types. Simplicity scales perfectly from cover-hero to small facebook-card.
- **Brand Palette:** Works with any brand palette. Clean style lets colors speak clearly.
- **Pairing:** Can be combined with data-visual elements for statistics-heavy articles.
