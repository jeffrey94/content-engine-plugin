# Corporate Modern

## Brief
Clean, polished illustration with subtle gradients, minimal decoration, and a premium digital aesthetic -- the default style for most blog content.

## When to Use
- **Content Pillars:** All pillars (default style). Primary fit: Policy & Compliance, Funding & Financing.
- **Topic Signals:** Default when no strong style signal is detected. Also triggered by: compliance, regulation, financial, business, professional, corporate, strategy, report, announcement
- **Audience Context:** The safe, professional choice for any business audience. Conveys trust, authority, and modernity. This is the "if in doubt, use this" style for B2B fintech content.

## Core Characteristics
Corporate modern is the visual language of premium SaaS products and fintech landing pages. It is polished without being flashy, sophisticated without being cold. Clean geometry meets subtle gradients and carefully controlled whitespace. Every element feels intentional and considered. This is the default brand style because it communicates values of trust, modernity, and professionalism.

## Lines
- **Stroke Weight:** Thin and precise, 1-1.5px. Consistent throughout.
- **Endpoints:** Clean rounded caps.
- **Shape Vocabulary:** Smooth curves, perfect circles, rounded rectangles with consistent radii. Geometric but not rigid -- softened by curves.
- **Borders:** Minimal. Prefer separation through whitespace and color rather than outlines.
- **Refinement:** Every line is intentional. No stray marks, no decorative flourishes.

## Texture
- **Fill:** Subtle linear gradients allowed (5-10% color shift, not dramatic). Solid fills for smaller elements.
- **Background:** Clean solid color, subtle gradient wash, or very faint geometric pattern at low opacity.
- **Patterns:** Minimal. Occasional subtle dot grid or thin line pattern at 5-10% opacity as background texture.
- **Glass Effect:** Optional frosted glass or glassmorphism on overlay panels (semi-transparent with blur).

## Depth
- **Dimensionality:** Primarily 2D with subtle depth cues through layering and soft shadows.
- **Shadows:** Soft, diffused box shadows (offset 4-8px, blur 16-24px, 10-15% opacity). Used sparingly on floating elements.
- **Layering:** Card-based design. Elements sit on subtle floating panels/cards above the background.
- **Elevation:** 2-3 elevation levels maximum. Background, surface, elevated element.

## Color Application
- **Primary Color:** Key visual elements, main icons, important headings. Used confidently but not excessively (30-40%).
- **Secondary Color:** Supporting panels, secondary icons, background accents (20-30%).
- **Accent Color:** CTAs, highlights, small emphasis elements, data callouts (5-10%).
- **Background:** Light neutral (off-white, very light gray, or tinted with brand color at 3-5%).
- **Gradients:** Subtle gradients between primary and secondary, or within the primary color (light to standard).
- **Rule:** Colors should feel intentional and premium. No bright neon, no jarring combinations.

## Element Vocabulary
- **Approved:** Abstract geometric shapes (overlapping circles, flowing curves), simplified business icons (graph trending up, shield, document, handshake silhouette, building), floating UI cards, abstract data visualizations, device mockups (phone/laptop silhouettes), subtle particle or dot decorations
- **Forbidden:** Cartoon elements, hand-drawn marks, grungy textures, aggressive graphics, clipart, busy patterns, overly literal illustrations
- **Malaysian Context:** Clean silhouettes of Malaysian landmarks (Petronas Towers, parliament), stylized government building icons, abstract representations of Malaysian business scenes

## Typography Approach
- **Font Category:** Modern sans-serif with good readability (Inter, SF Pro, Outfit, or brand heading font)
- **Weight:** Bold for headlines, regular or light for body. Strong weight contrast.
- **Sizing:** Generous headline size with clear hierarchy. Large heading, significantly smaller subtext.
- **Text-on-Image:** Text on clean panels or clear whitespace areas. Subtle backdrop blur if text overlays a busy area.
- **Letter Spacing:** Slightly increased for headlines (2-5% tracking) for a premium feel.

## Prompt Fragments

**style_descriptor:**
"Clean corporate modern illustration style with polished geometry, subtle gradients, and premium digital aesthetic. Minimal decoration, controlled whitespace, and soft diffused shadows on floating elements. The visual language of modern fintech and SaaS -- trustworthy, sophisticated, and professionally restrained."

**visual_constraints:**
"Clean precise lines at 1-1.5px, subtle linear gradients allowed, soft diffused shadows on floating panels, rounded geometry, premium sans-serif typography with generous spacing, minimal decoration, controlled whitespace (30%+ of image), card-based layered design, no more than 3 elevation levels, muted and sophisticated color application"

**negative_prompt:**
"No cartoon elements, no hand-drawn marks, no grungy textures, no aggressive high-contrast graphics, no clipart, no busy patterns, no neon colors, no 3D rendering, no photographic elements, no overly literal illustrations, no decorative flourishes"

## Compatibility Notes
- **Moods:** Professional (recommended -- the natural pairing), Energetic (good -- increase gradient vibrancy and add more accent color). **Avoid Warm** -- corporate polish contradicts warm's organic approachability.
- **Image Types:** Excellent for all three types. This style's scalability and clarity make it universally safe.
- **Brand Palette:** Designed to work perfectly with any professional brand palette. The subtle gradient technique extends limited palettes elegantly.
- **Default Status:** This is the fallback style when auto-selection has no strong signal. The `standard` preset uses this style.
