# Watercolor

## Brief
Soft, flowing illustration with translucent washes, bleeding edges, and organic shapes that evoke warmth, editorial beauty, and human touch.

## When to Use
- **Content Pillars:** Practical Guides (lifestyle angle), Industry Opportunities (success stories)
- **Topic Signals:** success story, case study, community, partnership, lifestyle, growth journey, transformation, people, team, culture, well-being
- **Audience Context:** When the article tells a human story or connects emotionally. Best for content about people, communities, and journeys rather than hard data or regulations. Makes business content feel less corporate and more relatable.

## Core Characteristics
Watercolor illustration uses translucent color washes that blend and bleed naturally, creating a soft, organic aesthetic. Colors pool and feather at edges rather than stopping at crisp boundaries. The style feels artistic, editorial, and emotionally warm -- like an illustration in a premium lifestyle magazine. It conveys that behind the business content, there are real people and real stories.

## Lines
- **Stroke Weight:** Variable, flowing. Thicker where the brush pressed, thinner at tails. 1-4px range.
- **Endpoints:** Feathered, tapering naturally. Never hard-stopped.
- **Shape Vocabulary:** Organic, flowing shapes. Soft edges, natural curves. No perfect geometry.
- **Borders:** Wash edges that bleed and feather. No hard borders unless framing text zones.
- **Outline:** Minimal. Shapes defined by color boundaries rather than outlines. Optional light pencil-sketch outlines visible beneath washes.

## Texture
- **Fill:** Translucent watercolor washes with visible color variation within each area. Wet-on-wet effects where colors blend.
- **Background:** Paper texture (cold-press watercolor paper). Off-white with subtle tooth/grain.
- **Patterns:** Natural blooms and color bleeding where washes meet. Paint splatter accents as decorative elements.
- **Water Effects:** Cauliflower edges (backruns) where wet paint meets dry areas. These imperfections are part of the charm.

## Depth
- **Dimensionality:** Flat to minimal depth. Layered washes create subtle depth through transparency.
- **Shadows:** Painted shadows using deeper wash of the same color. Soft and diffused, never sharp.
- **Layering:** Multiple transparent wash layers visible. Earlier layers show through later ones. This creates rich, luminous color.

## Color Application
- **Primary Color:** Main wash areas, key subjects. Applied at 40-60% opacity for translucent effect.
- **Secondary Color:** Background washes, supporting elements. Even more translucent (20-40% opacity).
- **Accent Color:** Concentrated spots of saturated color for emphasis. Small areas at full intensity.
- **Blending:** Colors naturally blend where they meet. Primary into secondary creates organic transitions.
- **White Space:** The paper itself (off-white) is a color. Let it breathe through the washes.
- **Rule:** Colors should look wet and luminous. Avoid opaque, flat application.

## Element Vocabulary
- **Approved:** Loose floral elements, flowing abstract shapes, soft landscape elements (hills, clouds, water), organic business metaphors (growing trees, flowing rivers as journey metaphors), stylized people silhouettes (faceless, graceful), botanical accents, paint splatter decorations
- **Forbidden:** Sharp geometric shapes, technical diagrams, precise data visualizations, machine-perfect lines, corporate icons, detailed faces, complex machinery
- **Malaysian Context:** Tropical flowers (hibiscus, frangipani) as wash elements, flowing batik-inspired organic patterns, lush green landscape washes suggesting Malaysian scenery, warm golden tones evoking Malaysian sunlight

## Typography Approach
- **Font Category:** Elegant serif or humanist sans-serif (Lora, Source Serif, or brand heading font)
- **Weight:** Regular to medium. Complement the softness of the illustration -- not too heavy.
- **Sizing:** Elegant proportions. Not oversized. Let the watercolor art share the spotlight.
- **Text-on-Image:** **Critical: text MUST sit on solid-color backing panels** (white or light tint), not directly on watercolor washes. Watercolor's varied color makes text unreadable without a clean backdrop.
- **Text Backing:** Semi-transparent white or light panel behind text areas. Edges can be soft/feathered to blend with the watercolor.

## Prompt Fragments

**style_descriptor:**
"Watercolor illustration style with translucent color washes, soft bleeding edges, and organic flowing shapes on textured watercolor paper. Colors pool and blend naturally with visible wet-on-wet effects. The aesthetic is editorial, warm, and artistically refined -- like a premium lifestyle magazine illustration. Luminous and airy with generous white paper breathing through the washes."

**visual_constraints:**
"Translucent watercolor washes at 40-60% opacity, visible paper texture (cold-press watercolor paper), bleeding feathered edges on all shapes, organic flowing shapes only, variable brushstroke line weight, paint splatter accents, no hard geometric edges, layered transparent washes, text must have solid-color backing panel for readability, generous white paper space"

**negative_prompt:**
"No sharp edges, no perfect geometry, no flat opaque fills, no digital gradients, no hard borders, no technical elements, no corporate icons, no machine-perfect lines, no 3D rendering, no photographic elements, no dark or heavy backgrounds, no complex data visualizations"

## Compatibility Notes
- **Moods:** Warm (recommended -- the perfect match. Soft colors + organic shapes = maximum warmth). **Avoid Professional** (watercolor's organic imprecision undermines corporate authority). **Avoid Energetic** (watercolor is inherently calm and flowing).
- **Image Types:** Cover-hero (good -- with solid text backing), Instagram-card (good -- beautiful aesthetic for visual-first platform). **Caution with facebook-card** -- at small preview sizes, watercolor's soft edges can make text hard to read. Must ensure text backing panels are large and clear.
- **Brand Palette:** Works with warm and earthy palettes. May need adjustment for very cool or corporate blue palettes -- add warmer undertones.
- **Text Readability:** The #1 concern with this style. Always use solid-color backing panels behind any text elements.
