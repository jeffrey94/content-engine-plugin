# Isometric

## Brief
2.5D axonometric illustration with consistent 30-degree angles, giving flat objects a three-dimensional appearance without perspective distortion.

## When to Use
- **Content Pillars:** Industry Opportunities (primary), Funding & Financing (secondary)
- **Topic Signals:** data center, semiconductor, supply chain, manufacturing, infrastructure, logistics, warehouse, factory, technology, digital transformation, construction
- **Audience Context:** When the topic involves systems, infrastructure, or processes that benefit from a spatial/architectural visualization. Helps SME owners understand complex physical or digital systems.

## Core Characteristics
Isometric illustration presents objects at a consistent 30-degree angle, creating a clean 2.5D effect that makes flat designs feel spatial and architectural. The style excels at showing how systems connect -- buildings, data flows, supply chains, manufacturing processes. It feels technical and precise while remaining approachable, unlike full 3D rendering.

## Lines
- **Stroke Weight:** Consistent 1.5-2px for structure, 1px for details.
- **Endpoints:** Straight cuts (not rounded) for a technical feel.
- **Shape Vocabulary:** Cubes, rectangular prisms, cylinders, hexagonal platforms. All shapes follow the isometric grid.
- **Borders:** Clean edges defined by line contrast, not outlines. Optional isometric grid visible at low opacity in background.
- **Angles:** All horizontal lines at exactly 30 degrees from true horizontal. Vertical lines remain vertical.

## Texture
- **Fill:** Flat color with differentiated faces (top face lighter, left face medium, right face darker) to suggest 3D form.
- **Background:** Light neutral or subtle isometric grid. Never busy.
- **Patterns:** Minimal surface patterns. Occasional window grids on buildings, line patterns on roads.
- **Face Differentiation:** Three tones of the same color for top/left/right faces creates depth without shadows.

## Depth
- **Dimensionality:** 2.5D isometric projection. No vanishing points, no perspective convergence.
- **Shadows:** Optional small contact shadows (directly below objects) in very muted color. No cast shadows.
- **Layering:** Objects can stack vertically and overlap. Use the isometric grid to maintain spatial consistency.
- **Scale:** Maintain consistent scale across all objects in the scene. No forced perspective.

## Color Application
- **Primary Color:** Main building/structure faces and key elements.
- **Secondary Color:** Supporting structures, platforms, ground plane.
- **Accent Color:** Highlights on active elements (data flow arrows, highlighted sections, glowing screens).
- **Face Shading:** For each colored face, use three tones: base color (top), 10% darker (left), 20% darker (right).
- **Background:** Very light or white to let the isometric scene stand out.
- **Rule:** Limit to brand palette colors. The three-face shading creates visual variety without new colors.

## Element Vocabulary
- **Approved:** Buildings (offices, factories, warehouses), technology devices (servers, screens, phones), infrastructure (roads, bridges, ports), abstract data flow (arrows, connecting lines, glowing paths), vehicles (trucks, ships as simple block forms), trees and landscaping (simple geometric forms)
- **Forbidden:** Realistic vehicles, detailed human figures, photographic textures, organic/natural landscapes, complex machinery with moving parts
- **Malaysian Context:** Simplified Petronas Towers as isometric blocks, factory/industrial park scenes, port/shipping container stacks, data center server room layouts

## Typography Approach
- **Font Category:** Clean sans-serif with geometric character (e.g., DIN, Eurostile, or brand heading font)
- **Weight:** Medium to bold. Technical precision over warmth.
- **Sizing:** Moderate. Text should not compete with the isometric scene.
- **Text-on-Image:** Place text in clear areas outside the isometric scene, or on a flat panel/banner element within the scene. Never float text over complex geometry.
- **Labels:** Optional labels on elements using thin leader lines.

## Prompt Fragments

**style_descriptor:**
"Isometric 2.5D illustration with consistent 30-degree axonometric projection. Clean geometric shapes with three-face shading (top lighter, sides progressively darker). Technical but approachable, showing spatial relationships between system components. No perspective distortion."

**visual_constraints:**
"Consistent 30-degree isometric angle, three-face color shading on all 3D forms, no perspective vanishing points, clean geometric shapes, 1.5-2px line weight, flat color fills with face differentiation, minimal contact shadows only, consistent scale across all elements, sans-serif geometric typography"

**negative_prompt:**
"No perspective projection, no vanishing points, no realistic 3D rendering, no complex textures, no photographic elements, no detailed human figures, no organic shapes, no hand-drawn elements, no gradient fills on faces"

## Compatibility Notes
- **Moods:** Professional (recommended), Energetic (recommended). Avoid Warm -- isometric's technical precision clashes with warm's organic softness.
- **Image Types:** Cover-hero (recommended), Instagram-card (good). **Caution with facebook-card** -- isometric scenes have too much detail for small preview sizes. If used for facebook-card, simplify to a single small isometric object (e.g., one building) rather than a full scene.
- **Brand Palette:** Works well with any palette. The three-face shading technique naturally extends a limited palette.
- **Complexity:** Manage element count carefully. 3-5 isometric objects for cover-hero, 1-2 for facebook-card, 2-3 for instagram-card.
