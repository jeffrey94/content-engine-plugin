# Hand-Drawn

## Brief
Sketch-like illustration with visible strokes, slight imperfections, and a warm notebook or whiteboard aesthetic.

## When to Use
- **Content Pillars:** Practical Guides (primary), Funding & Financing (secondary for approachable financial guides)
- **Topic Signals:** guide, how to, how-to, step-by-step, comparison, checklist, tips, tutorial, beginner, explained
- **Audience Context:** When the article aims to be approachable and non-intimidating. Ideal for breaking down complex financial or regulatory topics for first-time SME owners. The hand-drawn feel says "this is simple and human."

## Core Characteristics
Hand-drawn illustration deliberately embraces imperfection to feel warm, human, and approachable. Lines have natural variation in weight and aren't perfectly straight. Shapes are slightly irregular. The overall effect is like a skilled person sketched this on a whiteboard or in a Moleskine notebook -- confident but not machine-precise. This style disarms readers who might feel overwhelmed by complex business topics.

## Lines
- **Stroke Weight:** Variable 1.5-3px with natural hand pressure variation. Slightly thicker at stroke starts and ends.
- **Endpoints:** Slightly tapered or trailing off naturally. Not perfectly capped.
- **Shape Vocabulary:** Organic rounded shapes, slightly wobbly circles, hand-drawn rectangles with imperfect corners. Arrows with personality.
- **Borders:** Optional hand-drawn border frame (like a notebook page edge). Never machine-perfect.
- **Character:** Lines may slightly overshoot corners or not perfectly close shapes -- this is intentional.

## Texture
- **Fill:** Light watercolor-like washes, crosshatch shading, or simple color fills with visible brush strokes.
- **Background:** Paper texture (subtle), grid paper, whiteboard, or kraft paper feel. Light and unobtrusive.
- **Patterns:** Hand-drawn dashes, dots, small stars, simple crosshatching for emphasis areas.
- **Pencil/Pen Feel:** Should look like it was drawn with a felt-tip pen or soft pencil, not a ballpoint or technical pen.

## Depth
- **Dimensionality:** Mostly 2D with occasional simple shading for emphasis (crosshatch or light wash).
- **Shadows:** Hand-drawn shadow lines (short parallel hatch marks) below key objects only. Not realistic shadows.
- **Layering:** Elements can overlap casually, like doodles on a page. No strict layering rules.

## Color Application
- **Primary Color:** Main illustration elements, key icons, important text underlines.
- **Secondary Color:** Background washes, supporting elements, secondary icons.
- **Accent Color:** Highlights, circled items, asterisks, exclamation marks, "important" callouts.
- **Limited Palette:** Use 2-3 colors plus a dark line color. Hand-drawn style works best with restrained color.
- **Application:** Colors should look hand-applied -- slightly uneven fills, not perfect computer fills.

## Element Vocabulary
- **Approved:** Sketch-style icons (lightbulbs, arrows, checkboxes, numbered lists, thought bubbles, simple stick figures, calculator doodles, money symbols), annotation marks (circles, underlines, asterisks), simple charts drawn by hand, process flow doodles
- **Forbidden:** Photographic elements, complex detailed illustrations, machine-perfect geometry, realistic faces, corporate stock imagery, 3D rendering
- **Malaysian Context:** Hand-drawn RM symbol, simplified sketched shophouse, doodled Malaysian flag, simple food illustrations (when relevant), sketched government building outlines

## Typography Approach
- **Font Category:** Rounded sans-serif or handwritten-style font (Nunito, Comic Neue, or brand font with rounded variant)
- **Weight:** Medium weight. Not too bold -- should feel like handwriting.
- **Sizing:** Generous sizing for headlines with a casual, friendly feel.
- **Text-on-Image:** Text can be integrated naturally as if written alongside the sketches. Labels with hand-drawn arrows pointing to elements.
- **Annotations:** Use handwritten-style notes, circled numbers, and underlined keywords as part of the visual design.

## Prompt Fragments

**style_descriptor:**
"Hand-drawn sketch illustration style with visible line variation, slightly imperfect shapes, and a warm notebook aesthetic. Lines have natural pressure variation like a felt-tip pen.

**visual_constraints:**
"Variable line weight with hand-drawn quality, slightly imperfect shapes and lines, limited 2-3 color palette plus line color, paper or whiteboard background texture, no machine-perfect geometry, hand-applied color fills, annotation-style text labels, sketch-like icons and symbols, doodle aesthetic"

**negative_prompt:**
"No machine-perfect lines, no precise geometry, no gradients, no 3D rendering, no photographic elements, no stock imagery, no corporate polish, no complex detailed illustrations, no realistic rendering, no digital perfection"

## Compatibility Notes
- **Moods:** Warm (recommended -- perfect match), Professional (good -- can feel like expert's quick sketch), Energetic (good -- dynamic doodle energy). Works with all moods but warm is the sweet spot.
