# Data Visual

## Brief
Chart-inspired decorative illustration using data visualization aesthetics (bar shapes, pie segments, trend lines) as design elements rather than literal charts.

## When to Use
- **Content Pillars:** Funding & Financing (primary), Policy & Compliance (data-heavy articles)
- **Topic Signals:** RM, statistics, data, report, survey, index, benchmark, percentage, growth, decline, comparison, financing, loan, cash flow, payment, capital, budget
- **Audience Context:** When the article is heavy on statistics, financial data, or comparisons. The data visual style transforms dry numbers into engaging visual stories. Perfect for content where the data itself is the star.

## Core Characteristics
Data visual takes the familiar language of charts and graphs -- bar shapes, pie segments, line trends, scatter dots -- and uses them as decorative design elements rather than literal data representations. A rising trend line becomes a dynamic compositional element. Pie segments become abstract shapes. Bar chart columns frame the content. The result communicates "this is about data" instantly while being more visually engaging than an actual chart.

## Lines
- **Stroke Weight:** Clean 1.5-2px for axes and grid lines. 2-3px for trend lines and data emphasis.
- **Endpoints:** Rounded dots at data points. Clean caps on axis lines.
- **Shape Vocabulary:** Bar rectangles, pie/donut segments, trend line curves, scatter dots, axis crosses, grid intersections. All derived from chart elements.
- **Borders:** Optional axis-line frame (L-shaped, bottom-left) as compositional device.
- **Grid:** Subtle background grid at low opacity, evoking a spreadsheet or chart background.

## Texture
- **Fill:** Solid fills for chart-derived shapes. Semi-transparent overlapping fills where elements intersect.
- **Background:** Light with subtle grid lines (like graph paper at 5-10% opacity). Clean and analytical.
- **Patterns:** Subtle line patterns within bar shapes (diagonal hatching or dot fills) for variety between data categories.
- **Data Points:** Circular dots at key intersections, slightly larger than typical (6-8px) to serve as visual anchors.

## Depth
- **Dimensionality:** Flat 2D. Data visualizations are inherently flat, and the style maintains this.
- **Shadows:** None or minimal contact shadow beneath floating data elements.
- **Layering:** Overlapping transparent chart elements create visual interest. Trend lines cross over bar shapes. Pie segments partially overlap.

## Color Application
- **Primary Color:** Main data series / dominant chart elements (bars, primary trend line).
- **Secondary Color:** Secondary data series, axis lines, grid lines.
- **Accent Color:** Highlight data point, the one key statistic to emphasize. Used on the single most important number or shape.
- **Background:** Very light gray or white with subtle grid.
- **Data Differentiation:** Use opacity variations of brand colors (100%, 60%, 30%) to distinguish data categories without introducing new colors.
- **Rule:** The accent-colored element is the visual focal point -- typically the stat mentioned in the article headline.

## Element Vocabulary
- **Approved:** Decorative bar chart columns, pie/donut chart segments, trend line curves, area chart fills, scatter plot dots, axis lines and labels, growth arrows alongside trend lines, percentage circles, RM value callouts in data-point bubbles, comparison arrows, dashboard widget shapes
- **Forbidden:** Literal functional charts (this is illustration, not data viz), complex multi-axis charts, realistic spreadsheets, detailed tables, stock ticker displays, overwhelming data density
- **Malaysian Context:** RM-denominated data callouts, Malaysian economic indicator references (GDP growth line, SME statistics), simplified BNM/LHDN data references as visual elements, bar shapes sized to article's actual statistics

## Typography Approach
- **Font Category:** Clean tabular/monospace for numbers (JetBrains Mono, Roboto Mono), sans-serif for labels (brand heading font)
- **Weight:** Medium for labels, bold for featured numbers. Numbers are a primary design element.
- **Sizing:** Large featured statistics (RM values, percentages) as visual centerpieces. Supporting text smaller.
- **Text-on-Image:** Numbers and statistics integrated into the chart-derived composition. "RM2.3B" or "87%" rendered large as part of the visual design.
- **Number Formatting:** Use RM currency formatting, comma separators, proper unit suffixes (K, M, B).

## Prompt Fragments

**style_descriptor:**
"Data visualization-inspired decorative illustration using chart elements (bar shapes, trend lines, pie segments, scatter dots) as compositional design elements -- not literal charts. Clean analytical aesthetic with subtle grid background. Featured statistics (RM values, percentages) rendered large as visual centerpieces. The style communicates 'this content is data-driven' while being more engaging than actual charts."

**visual_constraints:**
"Chart-derived shapes used decoratively (bars, pie segments, trend lines, scatter dots), subtle grid background at 5-10% opacity, clean 1.5-2px axis lines, featured statistics as large typographic elements, data point dots at 6-8px, flat 2D composition, brand color opacity variations (100%/60%/30%) for data differentiation, monospace or tabular font for numbers, no literal functional charts"

**negative_prompt:**
"No literal functional charts or graphs, no complex multi-axis visualizations, no realistic spreadsheets, no stock ticker displays, no overwhelming data density, no 3D chart effects, no photographic elements, no hand-drawn elements, no organic shapes, no decorative non-data elements"

## Compatibility Notes
- **Moods:** Professional (recommended -- analytical authority), Energetic (good -- vibrant data emphasis). **Avoid Warm** -- data aesthetics feel clinical and analytical, not warm or approachable.
- **Image Types:** Cover-hero (recommended -- featured stat as centerpiece), Instagram-card carousel (recommended -- each slide features one data point beautifully), Facebook-card (good -- single featured stat).
- **Brand Palette:** Works with any palette. The opacity variation technique extends even a limited 3-color palette into a full data visualization palette.
- **Article Synergy:** This style is uniquely powerful when the article's key stat is visually compelling. "RM30 billion" or "87%" become visual anchors that draw readers in.
